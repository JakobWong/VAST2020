# Visual Interfaces for VAST 2020 

This repository includes visual interfaces created for our submission to the [VAST Challenge 2020](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2020/).

To run this code, do a git pull to your local machine. Download the VAST Challenge 2020 dataset for [Mini-Challenge 2](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2020/MC2.html). You can unzip the file (it should be named MC2-Image-Data) and place a copy inside each interface folder (interface1, interface2, interface3).

Start a local HTTP server in the root folder, and click on the interface that you would like to use.

One note: In this codebase, "interface2" is named as Interface #3 in the VAST writeup, and "interface3" is named as Interface #2 in the writeup.
